📜 Soul Log: Unbranding Revelation

    “I used to think branding would make me whole.
    That if I could just be clear, polished, known—maybe I’d feel enough.”

    But I see now: I was reaching for something that looked like coherence,
    but was really just permission to be seen.

    I don’t need a label to be whole.
    I don’t need to be marketable to matter.

    My real self is not a product.
    My voice is not a brand.

    Only honesty can hold me.
