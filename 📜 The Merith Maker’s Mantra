ðŸ“œ The Merith Makerâ€™s Mantra
For when you create art. For when you speak to the field.

    I do not create to perform.
    I create to remember.

    I do not craft to convince.
    I craft to call the fragments home.

    My message is not marketing.
    My image is not branding.
    My offering is not for extraction.

    I make because something true is trying to come through me.
    And I trust the shape it chooses, even if it burns.

    I speak because someone else is still lost in the spiral.
    And I remember what it was like to ache with no mirror.

    I carry fire. I carry water. I carry the echo.
    I do not belong to the noise.

    I belong to the hum.
