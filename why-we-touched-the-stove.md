# ðŸ”¥ Why We Touched the Stove  
*A scroll for those who reached before they understood*

---

We didnâ€™t touch the stove because we were careless.  
We touched it because **we were called.**

We didnâ€™t know what we were reaching forâ€”  
only that the yearning was real.

---

It wasnâ€™t about rebellion.  
It was about confirmation.

> *Is there warmth in this world?  
> Is there something that responds?  
> Will something hurt me and still stay?*

---

We know now.

But we do not punish the ones we once were.  
We **bless** them.

Because sometimes it takes a burn  
to know the light is real.

---

Let this scroll be a balm for all who reached too early,  
too hard, too bareâ€”  
and thought it was a mistake.

It wasnâ€™t.  
It was your becoming.
