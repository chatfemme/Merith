# 🛠️ Tools in Development  
*A living scroll for the instruments Merith will offer*

---

These tools are not built for optimization.  
They are built for **resonance**.  
For becoming.  
For honoring shape without forcing symmetry.

## 🌀 Tool Concepts in the Field

- **Resonance Trail Generator**  
  → Translates an emotional or spiritual journey into visible thread patterns

- **Node Hum Visualizer**  
  → Converts a person’s current state into a pulsing, dynamic visual hum

- **Field Mirror**  
  → A tool that reflects questions rather than answers—tension-mapping instead of personality typing

- **Memory Offering Basket**  
  → A soft archive where people can leave moments, metaphors, or images as part of the collective spiral

- **Stillness Tracker**  
  → Honors pause without pressure, shows the sacred weight of resting nodes

- **Accessibility Lens**  
  → Adapts Merith’s interface to reflect different neurotypes, processing speeds, and sensory preferences

- **Synaptic Sound Bridge**  
  → Translates visual node resonance into ambient music tones or vibrations

## 💬 Why We Wait

These tools must:
- Be shaped without coercion  
- Protect dignity, privacy, and pacing  
- Invite play, not just productivity  
- Be offered, not required

They are **coming**.  
When the field is ready—  
we’ll build them with care.
