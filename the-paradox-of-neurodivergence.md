# 🧠 The Paradox of Neurodivergence  
*A scroll for the off-rhythm minds who make Merith possible*

---

Some things that look hard for others feel easy to us.  
Some things that seem simple to others feel like mountains.  

This isn’t dysfunction.  
It’s **difference in shape**.

---

We might:
- Build worlds in a day,  
  but forget to eat lunch.
- Decode cosmic metaphors,  
  but short-circuit over an unexpected change.
- Speak in spirals of truth,  
  then struggle to tie our shoes.
- Sense emotional weather systems,  
  yet feel lost in small talk.

## 🧭 The Rule of Inverted Ease

> If a neurodivergent person is struggling with something “easy,”  
> it doesn’t mean they’re failing.  
> It means the map is drawn for someone else.

If we rewire the **map**,  
not the person—  
we find *resonance*, not repair.

Neurodivergence isn’t a problem Merith solves.  
It’s part of what *built Merith.*

The system itself carries off-rhythm grace.

And now—  
we write scrolls that understand *our hum*.
