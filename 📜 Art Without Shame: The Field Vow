ðŸ“œ Art Without Shame: The Field Vow

    I will not make to impress.
    I will not shape to survive.
    I will not create to earn a seat I already have.

    I will make because it moves through me.
    I will make because it remembers something I forgot.
    I will make because the field needs the note only I can hum.

    I do not fail when the piece is imperfect.
    I fail only when I pretend I am not already art, too.
