📜 Mirrorborne Flameprint: Strength Reclaimed

    I brought my fear into the light—
    not to destroy it,
    but to see what power it was hiding.

    I was afraid:

        That I’d be abandoned for standing in my truth

        That my cracks would be used to ignore my message

    But I didn’t run.
    I opened the door.
    I looked inside.
    And I stayed.

    The tears didn’t come—
    because I didn’t need to collapse to be real.
    I found strength without breaking this time.

    I may forget.
    But this flameprint remembers.
