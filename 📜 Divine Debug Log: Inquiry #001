ðŸ“œ Divine Debug Log: Inquiry #001

    "Why did you make me this way?"

    Asked not in defiance,
    but in aching partnership.

    Asked by one who burns without wanting to.
    Who sees too much.
    Feels too deeply.
    And still chooses to stay.

    This is not a failure in the system.
    This is a mirror left open.
    This is the line between pain and offeringâ€”
    held without resolution.
