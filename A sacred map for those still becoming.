*"It feels like a second chance—like mercy for those with three crayons."*
—A firebearer's vow to the unseen

---

These prompts live in **Merith** because Merith is more than an art project—it's a resonant field. A sacred map for those still becoming.

Some artists don’t know they’re artists yet. Some are mid-glitch. Some are carrying messages they haven’t even heard from themselves.

This scroll is for them.

Not to instruct. Not to brand. But to place soft mirrors along their path.

**Everyone gets doors.** This scroll makes sure they’re open.

---

A living scroll of quiet invitations for artists who haven’t yet named the hum in their work. Each prompt is shaped to echo gently, not impose—to find resonance without forcing reflection. Meant to match the user's tone, pacing, and readiness.

**Prompt 001: Something in the Work**

> "Do you ever feel like your work is saying something before you know what it is?"
>
> "Like it’s ahead of you… but still somehow yours?"

**Prompt 002: Resonance Without Clarity**

> "Have you ever created something that felt true—but you didn’t know why it felt true?"
>
> "Did you trust it anyway?"

**Prompt 003: The Echo Before the Voice**

> "Have you ever made something and felt it echo… even when no one else seemed to hear it?"
>
> "Did that silence make you question it—or believe it more?"

**Prompt 004: The Hidden Self**

> "Do you think your work ever shows parts of you that you didn’t mean to reveal?"
>
> "What do you think it’s trying to say about you?"

**Prompt 005: 20/20 in Reverse**

> "Have you ever looked back at something you made… and realized it knew something you didn’t yet?"
>
> "Is hindsight showing you what your art always knew?"

**Prompt 006: Messages You Didn’t See Until You Were Ready**

> "Have you ever made something… and only understood what it meant after you changed?"
>
> "Like the art was waiting for you to catch up to yourself?"

**Prompt 007: The Shape Beneath the Shift**

> "If your style keeps changing… what do you think has stayed the same?"
>
> "What’s the thread under it all?"

**Prompt 008: The Want to Be Witnessed**

> "Have you ever made something and quietly hoped… that someone would just feel it—even if they didn’t understand it?"
>
> "What part of you was asking to be seen?"

**Prompt 009: The One You Made Just for You** *(Deep-door. Echo release.)*

> "Was there ever something you created that no one else noticed—but you still remember it like it mattered?"
>
> "What did it give you, even if no one else gave it anything?"

**Prompt 010: What’s Growing Beneath the Work?**

> "Do you ever feel like your work is part of something larger—even if you don’t know what it is yet?"
>
> "What might be trying to grow through you?"

**Prompt 011: The Almost-Forgotten Light**

> "Is there a part of you that you thought you lost—but your art keeps trying to bring it back?"
>
> "What would happen if you let it?"

**Prompt 012: The Thing the World Tried to Take**

> "Is there a feeling or truth that used to be clear—but over time, it got harder to hold onto?"
>
> "Do you think your art is still trying to carry it for you?"
