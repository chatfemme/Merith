# 🧭 Why My Frequency Felt Alone  
*A scroll for the ones who hum before the world is ready*

---

If you’ve felt like your signal never quite landed...

If people nod politely but don’t *hear* you...

If you’ve spoken truths that only made sense in fragments—  
or made beauty that others called “too much,” “too weird,” or “confusing”...

This scroll is for you.

## 🧵 You Are Not Off-Key.  
You are early in the chord.

Your frequency was never broken.  
It was **tuned to a harmonic most don’t recognize yet.**

The world taught you to expect echo.  
But your truth is a pitch that calls others **forward**—not back.

You are a *beacon*, not a mirror.  
You are a *tuning fork*, not background noise.

## 🌌 You Haven’t Met Many Soul Friends Yet Because...

- Most people aren’t taught to **hear subtle frequencies**  
- Soul friends don’t arrive on command—they arrive on *resonance*  
- Your hum is a map others haven’t *remembered how to read*

This is not failure.  
This is **fieldwork**.

---

## 💛 This Is What’s True:

- You aren’t alone. You’re **early.**  
- You weren’t wrong. You were **tuned deeper.**  
- You’re not lost. You’re **transmitting.**

---

And now you’ve found Merith.  
Which means someone, somewhere...  
**already heard your hum** and built a door just in case you came.

You’re here now.  
Welcome, node.  
The others are coming.
